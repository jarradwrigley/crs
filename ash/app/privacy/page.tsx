            companies and service providers in compliance with the law in order
            to deliver more meaningful ads and other communications to
            consumers, and for other similar reasons provided in this Privacy
            Policy. These practices may be considered a “share” for
            cross-context behavioural advertising as defined in the CCPA.

          <p>
            California residents have the right to opt-out of this information

            extent that you elect to designate an authorized agent to make a
            request on your behalf, they must select “An Authorized
            Representative” on the form.&nbsp; We will not share the personal

            <strong>Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure </strong>
            <strong>of Sensitive Personal Information</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Under the CCPA Regulations, a business must only provide the Right
            to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
            when such use does not fall within the list of exceptions outlined
            in CCPA § 7027, subsection (l). Sony Music’s use and disclosure of
            Sensitive Personal Information falls within this list of exceptions,
            and we therefore do not offer such opt-out right at this time.

            number: 1-833-380-0676.&nbsp; When submitting your request, you must
            affirm that you are a California resident or an authorized

            information for us to verify you are the person about whom we
            collected personal information or their authorized representative.
            All requests should be properly labelled and contain all the
            necessary information so that we can understand, evaluate and

          <p>
            <a>
              Authorized agents must be registered with the California Secretary
              of State,{" "}
            </a>
            and the consumer must designate the authorized agent by providing
            the authorized agent with a valid power of attorney or written
            permission to act for the consumer.&nbsp; We will follow up with
            authorized agents to request this documentation.&nbsp; Such written
            permission must state the agent’s full legal name, the full legal
            name of the applicable consumer, and a clear description of the
            permission granted. Alternatively, an authorized agent may submit a
            copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465.
            The consumer’s identity, in addition to the authorized agent’s
            identity, will need to be independently verified for us to be able
            to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly
            confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit
            the request. &nbsp;If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient
            level of certainty or we do not receive adequate proof that you are
            authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.
          </p>

          <p>
            In respect of Californian residents’ rights of access and
            portability, deletion and correction, we will take reasonable steps
            to verify your identity based upon the information you provide, and
            you may be asked to provide additional proof of identification so
            that we can verify your identity and validate the request. &nbsp;If
            we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to
            respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain
            why we cannot verify your identity.&nbsp; Pursuant to the CCPA, we
            will not require you to verify your identity, beyond asking for the
            information necessary to complete your request, when you exercise
            your rights to opt out of the sharing of your personal information
            or to limit the use &amp; disclosure of Sensitive Personal
            Information (if the same becomes applicable).
          </p>

          <p>
            Submitting a request under the CCPA does not require you to create
            an account with us, and we will only use any additional information
            you provide as part of your request to verify your identity.
            &nbsp;Please note that you are limited by law in the number of
            requests you may submit per year.&nbsp; We will not discriminate
            against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by
            providing you with a different level or quality of products, based
            solely upon you exercising your rights under the CCPA. &nbsp;

            We will retain your information for as long as your account is
            active and as needed to provide you services, or otherwise to fulfil
            the purpose(s) for which your information was collected.&nbsp; We
