              Any contests, sweepstakes, surveys, games or similar promotions
              (collectively “Promotions“) made available through the Site may be
              governed by specific rules that are separate from these Terms. By

              Music advises you to review carefully any specific rules

              Policy which, in addition to these Terms, governs any information
              you submit in connection with such activities. To the extent that
              the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms, the Promotion

              <strong>13. CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
              with, the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of its choice
              of law rules. Each party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
              the state and federal courts sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
              in the City of New York in the State of New York, and waives any
              jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such
              courts. Each party further agrees as follows: (i) any claim
              brought to enforce these Terms must be commenced within two (2)
              years of the cause of action accruing; (ii) no recovery may be
              sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses,
              except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and
              attorneys’ fees; and (iii) any claim must be brought individually
              and not consolidated as part of a group or class action complaint.

              <strong>14. GENERAL TERMS&nbsp;</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A</strong>.&nbsp;In the event that any of the provisions
              of the Terms are held by a court or other tribunal of competent
              jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited
              or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms
              shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;The Terms contain the entire agreement
              between you and us regarding the use of the Site, and supersede
              any prior agreement between you and us on such subject
              matter.&nbsp;The parties acknowledge that no reliance is placed on
              any representation made but not expressly contained in these
              Terms.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;Any failure by Sony Music to exercise or
              enforce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a
              waiver of such right or provision. The failure of either party to
              exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be
              deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>E.</strong>&nbsp;The Terms are not assignable,
              transferable or sublicensable by you except with Sony Music’s
              prior written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us
              without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in
              violation of the Terms shall be void.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>F.</strong>&nbsp;The section titles in the Terms are for
              convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
